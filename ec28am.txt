EC2 : Elastic COmpute Cloud

		--> CPU, Memory, Network, Disk		AWS EC2


ec2 = virtual servers = Instance

server = Virtual machine = Azure VM = GCP engine = Instance


On-Demand ec2 instance : No stable workloads, unpredictable usages, temporary testing.. 
Pricing : /hr, /sec(Min of 60 Sec)

Reserved Instances : predictable worklods, stable configuration, longterm usages.. 
Pricing : 1 Yr / 3 Yrs.. 

	Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration.. 
	Convertable RI : We can modify the instance configuration.. 
	Scheduled RI : repeated usages, persistant requests.. 

Pricing : Full Upfront : Pay 100% and get your instance.. 
	 Partial Upfront : pay 30-50% now, pay hourly basis with reduced price.. 
	 No Upfront : Pay everything monthly basis.. 

Spot Instances : If we have flexible start/stop durations.. 
We need to bid against the AWS pricing, When aws instance price is reduced or equal to customer quoted price, we will get this instance.

c4.4xlarge = 2$/hr.. 1$/hr, from date, to date..

EC2 is a region specific service.

How to launch a Windows ec2 instance.. 

Instance = Virtual Server runs in an AZ.. 

Mumbai = ap-south-1 : ap-south-1a, 1b & 1c.. 

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) : 
--> Quickstart  
--> My AMI 
--> Community AMI
--> AWS Marketplace

OS Hardening : CIS Center for internet security: Set OS benchmarks..  

Step 2 : Choose the Instance type..  : vCPU, Memory and Network Performance.. 

General Purpose : Stable perf.. 	: t2, t3, m4, m5, m5a.. 
Compute optimized : More CPU power	: c4, c5, c5n
GPU Instances : More grahic resources	: p2, g4dn
Memory optimised : More memory resources: r4, r5, r5a, r5ad, x1e, Z1d
Storage optimized : More disk usage 	: d2, i2, i3, i3en.. 

launch t2.micro.. 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM.. 

c5.xlarge  : 4vCPU, 8 RAM
m5.xlarge : 4vCPU, 16 RAM
t3.large : 2vCPU, 8 RAM

Step 3: Configure Instance Details

Shutdown behavior : STOP
Enable termination protection : Enabled

Step 4: Add Storage

Step 5 : Add tags

Step 6: Configure Security Group

Windows : RDP : 3389 : 0.0.0.0/0
Linux : SSH : 22 : 0.0.0.0/0

Public Key and PrivateKey mechanism..  Encryption / Decryption.. 
AWS keeps, publicKey, WHen we launch any instance, AWS automatically place the public key in that instance...
Privatekey will be given to us when we create a keypair.. (file format .pem).. 



How to connect : 
Verify these settings if you are npt able to connect : Windows : RDP : 3389 : 0.0.0.0/0

Remote desktop connection : Goto start and serach for "Remote Desktop connection"
Open --> Run --> give "mstsc"


Task : Launch an ec2 instance and get connect and change the password, try with the keypair password and custom setup password.. Which one works..!!

Task 2 : Along with administrator, create an additional user and provide RDP access to that user, try to connect along with "administrator".
