EC2 : Elastic COmpute Cloud

		--> CPU, Memory, Network, Disk		AWS EC2


ec2 = virtual servers = Instance

server = Virtual machine = Azure VM = GCP engine = Instance


On-Demand ec2 instance : No stable workloads, unpredictable usages, temporary testing.. 
Pricing : /hr, /sec(Min of 60 Sec)

Reserved Instances : predictable worklods, stable configuration, longterm usages.. 
Pricing : 1 Yr / 3 Yrs.. 

	Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration.. 
	Convertable RI : We can modify the instance configuration.. 
	Scheduled RI : repeated usages, persistant requests.. 

Pricing : Full Upfront : Pay 100% and get your instance.. 
	 Partial Upfront : pay 30-50% now, pay hourly basis with reduced price.. 
	 No Upfront : Pay everything monthly basis.. 

Spot Instances : If we have flexible start/stop durations.. 
We need to bid against the AWS pricing, When aws instance price is reduced or equal to customer quoted price, we will get this instance.

c4.4xlarge = 2$/hr.. 1$/hr, from date, to date..
--> Spot fleet request
--> Spot pricing history

EC2 is a region specific service.

--> Mumbai
--> NV

How to launch a Windows ec2 instance.. 

Instance = Virtual Server runs in an AZ.. 

Mumbai = ap-south-1 : ap-south-1a, 1b & 1c.. 

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) : 
--> Quickstart  
--> My AMI 
--> Community AMI
--> AWS Marketplace

OS Hardening : CIS Center for internet security: Set OS benchmarks..  

Step 2 : Choose the Instance type..  : vCPU, Memory and Network Performance.. 

General Purpose : Stable perf.. 	: t2, t3, m4, m5, m5a.. 
Compute optimized : More CPU power	: c4, c5, c5n
GPU Instances : More grahic resources	: p2, g4dn
Memory optimised : More memory resources: r4, r5, r5a, r5ad, x1e, Z1d
Storage optimized : More disk usage 	: d2, i2, i3, i3en.. 

launch t2.micro.. 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM.. 

c5.xlarge  : 4vCPU, 8 RAM
m5.xlarge : 4vCPU, 16 RAM
t3.large : 2vCPU, 8 RAM

Step 3: Configure Instance Details

Shutdown behavior : STOP
Enable termination protection : Enabled

Step 4: Add Storage

Step 5 : Add tags

Step 6: Configure Security Group

Windows : RDP : 3389 : 0.0.0.0/0
Linux : SSH : 22 : 0.0.0.0/0

Public Key and PrivateKey mechanism..  Encryption / Decryption.. 
AWS keeps, publicKey, WHen we launch any instance, AWS automatically place the public key in that instance...
Privatekey will be given to us when we create a keypair.. (file format .pem).. 



How to connect : 
Verify these settings if you are npt able to connect : Windows : RDP : 3389 : 0.0.0.0/0

Remote desktop connection : Goto start and serach for "Remote Desktop connection"
Open --> Run --> give "mstsc"


Task : Launch an ec2 instance and get connect and change the password, try with the keypair password and custom setup password.. Which one works..!!

Task 2 : Along with administrator, create an additional user and provide RDP access to that user, try to connect along with "administrator".

Security Groups : 
--> Acts as Firewall at Instance level.
--> No need to worry about the outbound rules, as SG is stateful.
--> We cannot "DENY" the traffic, only we can "ALLOW". 
--> We always needs to takes care about the inboudn rules.

NACL : Stateless..

--> CHanges to the SG, takes effect immediately. No need to restart/stop/start instance. all existing instances also opened with the traffic.


EIP : ELastic IP Address : Dedicated IP address allocated to our AWS account, Where we can use this with an ec2 instance / NIC.
(NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY)

--> If we required fixed IP address for our instance, we'll go with EIP..

Shared tenancy : Underlying hardware shared with multiple customers.
Dedicated tenancy : H/w Shared with only one customer.
	--> Dedicated Instance
	--> Dedicated Host


Volumes : 

Root Device Types : 
--> Instance Store VOlumes : 
--> EBS Volumes

Instance Store Volumes:
--> No FREE TIER ELigibility
--> We cannot STOP/Start the insatnce. 
--> Data is Ephemeral (Storage is Ephemeral).
--> Due to any reson, If instance is Stopped / Underlying Hardware failure happens, we will loss all the data...!!!!
--> We cannot resize the volumes. 

EBS : Elastic Block Storage..

Root Volume: Runs OS : gp2, io1 & standard.. 

General Purpose SSD : GP2 : Generally we use this, Supports most of the workloads, dev, test, low-latency interactive applications..  
Min: 1 GB , Max 16 TB
Performance : 1 GB we will get 3 IOPS... With Min of 100... Max: 16,000

Provisioned IOPS : io1 : Highest performance ebs volumes.. I/O Intensisive application, Relational DB, If you application required specific IOPS count.. 
Min: 4 GB , Max 16 TB
Performance : 1 GB we will get 50 IOPS... But we can choose required IOPS count..
Max: 64,000 (NITRO Instance)

Magnetic : standard : cheapest storage option.. IOPS N/A, We will get base performance.. 
Min: 1 GB , Max 1 TB


Throughput optimised HDD : St1 : low cost HDD volume, BigData, Data warehousing, log processing..  IOPS: 500.. Throughput : 500 MB/s.. 
Min: 500 GB , Max 16 TB

Cold HDD : sc1 : St1 : lowest cost HDD volume, Fewer scans per day..  BigData, Data warehousing, log processing..  IOPS: 250.. Throughput : 250 MB/s.. 
Min: 500 GB , Max 16 TB

VOlume Performance we measure using IOPS (Input and Output per Second).

** Decrease size is not possible.


Task : 

--> Add a new volume to your instance, Vol: 1 gb, GP2.. and make it avialble.. 
--> Increase the volume size to 2gb and make it avilable at OS level.

Task 2 : Launch another ec2 instance is same AZ as Task 1... , Detach the 2gb volume from task 1 instance and attach it to task 2 instance, verify all data avialble or not..!!!

Free Tier : 750 Hours/Month... 1 Instance..
--> EBS VOlumes, Will in In-Use state only.. Don't stop more than 2 Instances..


Snapshot : Backup option for our EBS volumes.. 
--> SS stores in S3 platform, But not on our s3 buckets.
--> We can use this SS to Share the VOlume or make it public.
--> SS are point-in-time copies.
