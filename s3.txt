S3 : Simple storage service : 

block based storage : EBS / Instancestore :  Designed to run OS.. 
object based storage : s3 : Designed to store the flat files.. We cannot install/run the applications.. 
network based storage : EFS / FSx : Storage over the network.. 


S3: Object based storage.
S3 platform global, doesn't required region selection. 
Whenever we are creating a bucket, i'll ask us to choose the region.
In s3 we use buckets to store the data. (Bucket = Folder with unique namespace)

Bucket name limitations: 
--> Bucket names are unique across the globe.
--> Min 3 char, Max 63 Char..
--> Should not start with . , end with ., adjesent .., No special characters
--> No Capital letters
--> Should not resemble IP address format.


Standard URL : 
https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname

Virtual path : 
https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname

==> If we want to share any data from our bucket, firstly enable "Public access settings" at bucket level.

S3 Versioning : 
--> Track all changes happening on our s3 objects.
--> Works as a backup option too

When Versioning : HIDE..
--> Whatever the file we delete, we'll get a delete marker.
--> Delete the Delete Markernto get that object back.. 

When Versioning : SHOW..
--> FIle delete permenetly


Lifecycle management rule : WE can transit objects storage class, and we can trigger to delete the objects automatically. 


Website : 
--> S3 Supports static website hosting option.

bucket name should be same as domain name (avinash.website)
--> For our website 99.99% avilablitiy 99.999999999% Durability

--> We need to provide atleast read only on our data to load the website.
