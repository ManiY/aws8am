RDS : Relational Database Service : 

--> Amazon Aurora (Mysql / postgresql compatable) : 
--> MySql : mysql workbench
--> OracleDB : toad
--> Mariadb : workbench
--> MSSQL : SSMS (Sql Server Management studio)
--> PostGreSQL (pgadmin)

NoSQL : Serverless : DynamoDB
Elasticache : In-memory caching solution.
	--> MemcacheD
	--> Redis

DMS : Database Migration Service
SMS : Server Migration Service

Homogenious : mysql --> DMS --> mysql
Heterogenious : mongoDB --> SCT (Schema Conversion tool) --> DMS --> Uplaoding AWS


RDS License :
--> General public license
--> Li (License Included)
--> BYOL (bring your own license)

--> For RDS instances, we don't get an IP address, we'll get an Endpoint name. Using this Endpoint name, we need to connect to our DB.

Task : Launch a Mysql RDS instance in CustomVPC Private Subnet. Launch a Jumpserver in CustomVPC Public Subnet install mysql workbecnh and connect to the RDS instance.

Launch MSSQL Express edition in RDS,  Launch a Jumpserver in CustomVPC Public Subnet install SSMS and connect to the RDS instance.

Launch PostGreSQL Express edition in RDS,  Launch a Jumpserver in CustomVPC Public Subnet install PgAdmin and connect to the RDS instance.

MultiAZ Deployment : Another copy of our DB creates in Another AZ.. Whenever primary copy goes down for maintennace/reboot, automatically backup copy will take all the load.
--> Purely for Disaster recover purpose. Not for Scaling purpose.

Snapshots : Backup copies of our RDS instance.
--> Manual SS
--> Automated SS

InPlace restoration.. Is not possible with RDS. 
We can restore as a new RDS Instance.


Aurora:
Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility
Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility

Regional : You provision your Aurora database in a single AWS Region.
Global : You can provision your Aurora database in multiple AWS Regions. Writes in the primary AWS Region are replicated with typical latency of less than 1 sec to secondary AWS Regions.
--> We have an option to choose multipe writer copies with Aurora.
--> Aurora Supports Max DB Size : 64 TB  (Remaining all DB : 16 TB)


DynamoDB : AWS NoSQL Database Service.. Serverless Architecture.. 

How many Read / Write required for application..!!!!
